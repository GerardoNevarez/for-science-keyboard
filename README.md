For Science is a 46 key ortholinear split keyboard PCB with a 3 key thumb cluster.

The goal of this project is to build a usable split keyboard with a PCB case within the 100x100mm cheap PCB size limit offered by some PCB manufactuers. Designed to be easy to build, it only supports serial communication over a TRRS cable and no LED support. The PCB is reversible, meaning that you need two of the same PCB to create a full keyboard.
